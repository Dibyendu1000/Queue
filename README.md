# Queue
In computer science, a queue is a collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal operations on the 
collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal 
position, known as dequeue.

1) The first program is a primitive Queue which enques data from rear and deques data from front
2) The second program is a implementation of Queue to record student data ( Name, class and roll)
